### Modern Javascript

Javascript is one of the most used platforms for application and website development to this day. In the beginning, due to the lack of back-end support and lack of technologies, Javascript was mostly used for front-end development. The creation of other technologies, such as NodeJS, allowed Javascript to work as the main back-end handler. NodeJS allowed Javascript to run like a server and not only inside the browser. With the creation of NodeJS came out NPM, or Node Package Manager. This allowed Javascript to become fully fleshed out with a package manager with modules similar to libraries in another language such as Python.

### OOP vs. Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming technique that accentuates the functional factors required for creating and implementing programs. It uses a declarative programming model where the variables and functions are the key elements. Due to the definition of functional programming, it is great for data science work, with the language R being the most popular among data scientists. It provides advantages such as efficiency, lazy evaluation, nested functions, bug-free code, and parallel programming. In other words, functional programming is to write statements that execute a particular task for the application within the function itself. Functions can be easily reused and invoked at any time. This helps ensure the code stays easily readable and saves time and effort recoding things that already have been created beforehand. Functional programming is based on six different concepts:

1. High Order Functions (HOF)
2. Pure functions
3. Recursion
4. Strict and Non-strict evaluation
5. Type systems
6. Referential Transparency

Functional languages are good for when you have a fixed set of things and as your code evolved, you add new operations on top of the existing ones. This is primarily accomplished through the use of new functions that use existing data types and existing functions already made.

On the other hand, object-oriented programming is a conceptual programming technique that uses objects as the keys. As such, it is an imperative programming model that uses objects and methods as the key elements. There are four main concepts for object-oriented programming:

1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation

In an object-oriented programming language, the objects can be easily reused in another application. In addition, new objects can be easily created for the same class, and code can be easily maintained and altered when the need arises. With this, comes the benefit of memory management. This is fantastic for creating large programs which then can be divided into smaller pieces and helps to plan out certain components or phases in their own unique ways. Object-oriented languages are good for when you have a set of fixed operations on things and as your code evolves you add new things. This can either be accomplished with the use of new classes that reuse existing methods or existing classes that are already made.

There are programming languages that support both. For example, Python and Java both support object-oriented concepts and functional concepts by supporting various inbuilt functions are can be imported through the use of external libraries that others have built.
