### What is Agile?

First, we should focus on the definition of Agile and implementations that exist within the DevOps world. According to the Agile
Manifesto website, the core of Agile is to bring people back into the construction of software, breaking down communication barriers
between developers, project managers, and other members of the team. The final core is the idea of embracing change. There are two
versions of Agile we will be talking about in this post. The first version is known as Scrum and the second is known as Kanban.

#### Scrum

The most important aspect of Scrum to remember is the backlog. The backlog is just a prioritized list of issues or features to work on.
Development teams using Scrum usually work in sprints where the team works to complete a set amount of work in a set amount of time. The
amount of work is usually decided before the sprint takes place so the team isn't overwhelmed or only implementing half-baked features.
The aim of the sprint is by the end to have produced a shippable version of the product so that updates and features are constantly being
added. Think of the product like a software, for example, a video game, where updates are constantly happening to fix bugs and take input from the community. 

A sprint begins with a planning session that is used to define what items from the backlog can be delivered upon and how that work will be accomplished. The first half of the session is between the development team and the product owner where they discuss which items will be accepted into the sprint, usually only the items the team thinks they have a shot of completing within the set time. In the second half of the session, the developers will break down individual stores into tasks to help the team accomplish their respective duties. 

While the sprint is ongoing, each workday begins with a standup where the product owner, team leader, and the development team discuss what work was done the previous day and what work they plan to do that day. They will also discuss if they have any blockers preventing the team from working on an item from the backlog. The meetings are generally short and only one person is allowed to speak at a time for a max of generally a minute. At the end of a sprint, the sprint review takes place. The first portion is the demo of the completed work that is shown to the stakeholders and the second portion is the sprint lookback. The sprint lookback is a chance for the team to look back at how the sprint went and how they could improve and who can improve. A burn-up chart is also usually kept to track the team's progress within the sprint which can be used to see if the backlog can be completed within the time frame or not. 

#### Kanban

Kanban is more flexible than Scrum as it only has three principles:

- Make all work visible
- Limit work in progress
- Practice continual self-improvement

As such, many teams can find Kanban harder to implement. However, since Kanban is so flexible it can be rendered in a way that is just the right fit for your team. Typically, Kanban implements the use of a board where all team members can see where all tasks lay in implementation. Teams typically work on one task at a time rather than having multiple tasks being rendered out at one like in a sprint. When an item is completed, work can be focused on the next priority. This allows teams to have fast responses to changes. Work-in-progress limits are also often defined before any work begins. These are limits on the number of items that can be in any given column at a time. This prevents code from sitting there for too long and time being wasted. While Kanban does not require meetings like Scrum, teams often will meet at the same frequency to Scrum teams to allow teams to know of any upcoming work and get progress reports. Similar to the burn-up chart in Scrum, Kanban uses a continuous flow diagram (CFD), a line chart that shows how many items are in each column in a system at a given time. Reasonably, these lines should be kept flat to prevent work build-up. The last important aspect of Kanban is the topic of continuous improvement, one of the pillars of Kanban. Teams will often meet and discuss any shortcomings of other team members and how they could improve for the future. This also applies to the work done as it can identify issues right away instead of later down the time and being corrects promptly.
