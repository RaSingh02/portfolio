This is my professional website that showcases a few blogs and many projects I have worked on in the past or am currently working on. It is built using the
Hugo static site generator and uses the [Hugo Profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) theme. The website is currently hosted on a Digital Ocean
Droplet but will be migrated to a AWS S3 bucket in the near future.
